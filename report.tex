Introduction.



LDA Model
1. Generative Model
Latent Dirichlet allocation treats each document in a corpus of text as a "bag of words", generated
by a probabilistic model.
As with any model, LDA makes simplifiying assumptions so that useful information can be extracted
from the corpus.
Each document is a random combination of topics.
Each topic is a random combination of words from some fixed vocabulary.
Each word in each document is randomly chosen from the combination of topics sampled for the document.
The number of words in each document is also randomly chosen.
All of these random values and combinations are sampled according to particular distributions with
known parameters.

2. Gibbs Sampling
While during the generative process the parameters are known, given the resultant corpus alone, it is unclear
which parameters were used.
However, using the given corpus, the parameters of the original model can be inferred or estimated.
